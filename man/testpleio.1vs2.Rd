\usage{
testpleio.1vs2(cross, Y, chr = "6", addcovar = NULL, intcovar = NULL,
  region.l = NA, region.r = NA, method = c("ML", "Pillai", "Wilks",
  "Hotelling-Lawley", "Roy"), int.method = c("bayes", "1.5lod"),

  n.simu = 1000, tol = 1e-07)
}
\arguments{
\item{cross}{An object of class \code{cross}. See
\code{read.cross} for details.}

\item{Y}{Matrix of multiple traits, with samples in the row,
traits in the column.}

\item{chr}{Optional vector indicating the chromosomes for which
LOD scores should be calculated. This should be a vector of
character strings referring to chromosomes by name; numeric values
are converted to strings.}

\item{addcovar}{Additive covariates, samples in the row.}

\item{intcovar}{Interactive covariates (interact with QTL genotype).}

\item{region.l}{Left bound}

\item{region.r}{Right bound}

\item{method}{choose from "ML" for maximum likelihood method for
LOD score, "Pillai", "Wilks", "Hotelling-Lawley", or "Roy" for the
corresponding MANOVA methods.}

\item{int.method}{"bayes" or "1.5lod" method to calculated the
interval of interest if \code{region.l} and \code{region.r} is not
specified.}

\item{search.method}{Searching method for two-QTL model, "fast" or
"complete".}

\item{RandomStart}{Use random starting point for the two-QTL model
or not. default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{RandomCut}{Use random cutting or not when there are traits
mapped to the same location. Default is \code{FALSE}, triats
mapped to the same location will be bound together.}

\item{simu.method}{"parametric" or "permutation" method for
simulations. Default is "parametric".}

\item{n.simu}{Number of simulations for p-value.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance value for the \code{qr} decomposition in
\code{lm} fitting.}
}
\value{
a list.
\item{LOD1}{LOD score of one dimensional joint mapping.}
\item{LOD2}{LOD score for estimate of best two QTL model, each trait
            is influenced by the left or the right QTL.}
\item{LODdiff}{Difference of best one QTL model and best two QTL model,
               LODdiff = max(LOD2) - max(LOD1)}
\item{pvalue}{P-value from parametric bootstrap simulations.}
\item{Group}{Indicating which traits are influenced by which QTL
under alternative.}
}
\description{
Test if multitriats are controlled by one pleiotrophic QTL or two
close linked QTLs. p-value is calculated from parametric
bootstrap, which takes the estimated parameters under null
hypothesis and generate data from them to get the null empirical
distribution of test statistic.
